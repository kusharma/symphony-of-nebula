{"lyrics": "**Verse 1**  \nIn the cradle of the night, where shadows dance and swirl,  \nStardust whispers secrets, as galaxies unfurl.  \nA symphony of colors, in the cosmic sea we find,  \nMelodies of wonder, echo through the mind.  \n\n**Chorus**  \nOh, the nebula's embrace, where dreams ignite the fire,  \nWaves of light entwining, lifting hearts ever higher.  \nFrom the ashes of creation, a spark begins to bloom,  \nIn the vastness of existence, we dissolve into the loom."}
