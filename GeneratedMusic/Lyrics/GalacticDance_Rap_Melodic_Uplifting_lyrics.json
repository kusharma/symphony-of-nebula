{"lyrics": "(Chorus)  \nDriftin\u2019 through the stars, we\u2019re glowing bright,  \nGalaxies align, painting dreams in the night.  \nWith every heartbeat, we rise and we soar,  \nLost in the cosmos, let\u2019s dance forevermore.\n\n(Verse)  \nIn the void, we find our way,  \nCosmic love\u2019s a guiding ray.  \nFlowing like the Milky Way,  \nTogether we\u2019ll never stray.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nDriftin\u2019 through the stars, we\u2019re glowing bright,  \nGalaxies align, painting dreams in the night.  \nWith every heartbeat, we rise and we soar,  \nLost in the cosmos, let\u2019s dance forevermore."}
