{"lyrics": "**Verse 1**  \nIn the cradle of the night, where stardust dreams ignite,  \nColors swirl in cosmic dance, painting skies with every glance.  \nFrom the whispers of the void, a symphony is born,  \nGuitar flames like shooting stars, a brand new dawn adorns.  \n\n**Chorus**  \nFeel the pulse of the universe, rising high and free,  \nMelodies of creation, echoing endlessly.  \nNebulae in bloom, a kaleidoscope of light,  \nTogether we\u2019re igniting the magic of the night.  \n\n**Verse 2**  \nGalaxies in motion, with rhythms that entwine,  \nEvery note a spark of life, a love song so divine.  \nAs we soar through endless skies, let the music guide our way,  \nIn this cosmic tapestry, we\u2019ll shine brighter every day."}
